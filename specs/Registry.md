# Overview

`registry.lua` is a Lua script implementing a **Registry Zone** within the AO/Arweave ecosystem, designed to register and manage Zones as defined in [`permaweb-libs/specs/spec-zones.md`](https://github.com/permaweb/permaweb-libs/blob/main/specs/spec-zones.md). It provides a generic, dynamic, and scalable solution for discovering and organizing Zonesâ€”modular, programmable entities representing users, organizations, channels, and more. Built by SpaceTurtle-DAO, this registry supports self-registration and updates, ensuring authenticity and flexibility.

This repository contains:
- `registry.lua`: The core script for the Registry Zone.
- `specs/`: Documentation for supported Zone Types (see below).

## Purpose

The Registry Zone addresses the need for a decentralized directory in the AO ecosystem, enabling:
- **Discovery**: Clients can find Zones (e.g., Velocity hubs, user profiles) by type and metadata.
- **Management**: Zones self-register and update their specs, maintaining a live, trusted index.
- **Interoperability**: Aligns with `spec-zones.md` and integrates with `velocity-protocol` for hub discovery.

## Features

- **Self-Registration**: Zones register using their own process ID (`msg.From`), ensuring authenticity.
- **Updates**: Zones can update their metadata dynamically via the `Register` handler.
- **Filtering and Paging**: The `GetZones` handler supports filtering by spec fields, with pagination for scalability.

## Spec Structure
Defined in `msg.Data` per `spec-zones.md`:
- **`type`**: `"registry"` (string) - Maps to `Zone-Type: Registry`.
- **`description`**: String - Purpose (e.g., `"Zone registry"`).
- **`version`**: String - Version (e.g., `"0.1"`).
- **`parent`**: (optional) String - Parent registry ID (e.g., `"reg0"`).

### Transaction Tags
- `Data-Protocol: Zone`
- `Zone-Type: Registry` (custom extension)

### Example
```json
{
  "type": "registry",
  "description": "Zone registry for hubs and users",
  "version": "0.1",
  "parent": "reg0"
